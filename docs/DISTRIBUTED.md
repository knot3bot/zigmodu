# Distributed Modules — Production Readiness

## Status Overview

| Module | Status | Tests | Notes |
|--------|:------:|:-----:|-------|
| **DistributedEventBus** | ✅ Ready | 3 | Cross-node pub/sub with heartbeat. Single-node verified. |
| **ClusterMembership** | ✅ Ready | 4 | Gossip protocol + health checks. Node join/leave/health tracking tested. |
| **SagaOrchestrator** | ✅ Ready | 5 | Auto-compensation saga with step logging. |
| **DistributedTransaction** | ⚠️ Beta | 5 | 2PC protocol. Needs persistence layer for production. |
| **KafkaConnector** | ⚠️ Beta | 0 | Producer/Consumer stubs. Needs broker integration testing. |
| **RaftElection** | ⚠️ Beta | 4 | Leader election + vote counting. Term tracking works. |
| **FailureDetector** | ⚠️ Beta | 6 | Accrual failure detector. Phi-threshold tested. |
| **WAL (eventbus/)** | 🔬 WIP | 0 | Write-ahead log. Implemented but not wired to DEB. |
| **DLQ (eventbus/)** | 🔬 WIP | 0 | Dead-letter queue. Implemented but not wired. |
| **Partitioner** | 🔬 WIP | 0 | Consistent hash partitioner. Not yet integrated. |

## Production Deployment Checklist

### Before going multi-node:
1. ✅ `ClusterMembership` — works for node discovery
2. ✅ `DistributedEventBus` — works for cross-node events
3. ⚠️ `RaftElection` — test with 3+ real nodes before using for leader election
4. ❌ `DistributedTransaction` — add SQLite/file persistence before production
5. ❌ WAL/DLQ — wire into DistributedEventBus for durability guarantees

### Recommended cluster size: 3-5 nodes

## Usage Example

```zig
// Node A (port 18080)
var cluster_a = try ClusterMembership.init(allocator, "node-a", "0.0.0.0", 18080);
var debus_a = try DistributedEventBus.init(allocator, "node-a", "0.0.0.0", 18080, cluster_a);

// Node B (port 18081)  
var cluster_b = try ClusterMembership.init(allocator, "node-b", "0.0.0.0", 18081);
var debus_b = try DistributedEventBus.init(allocator, "node-b", "0.0.0.0", 18081, cluster_b);

// Publish event on A, subscribe on B
try debus_b.subscribe("order.created", handleOrderCreated);
try debus_a.publish("order.created", order_data);
```
